This file is a combination of a product backlog and a list of known issues with the workbook. Note that the items are being implemented/solved in a slow or non-existent pace, mostly depending on my current interest in the project.

1. Features that would be nice ([Feature]/[Implemented])
	1.1. [Feature] Right now all the data (courses, programs etc) is stored locally in every users machine, resulting in lots of unneccessary data. A central database, from which the users fetches the data they need, would make more sense and would be easier to update and maintain.

2. Know issues and bugs ([Issue]/[Bug]/[Solved])
	2.1. [Solved] If the user removes courses in her study plan manually the data in the summary and course table will be inconsistent.
